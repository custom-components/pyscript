Configuration
-------------

Pyscript can be configured using the UI or via yaml. To use the UI, go to the
Settings -> Devices & services -> Integrations page and select "+" to add
``Pyscript Python scripting``. After that, you can change the settings at any
time by selecting "configure" under Pyscript Python scripting on the Settings
-> Devices & services -> Integrations page. For the new settings to take
effect, you will need to either select "Reload" from the overflow menu
(button with three dots) next to pyscript or call the ``pyscript.reload``
service from Developer tools -> Services.

Alternatively, for yaml configuration, add ``pyscript:`` to ``<config>/configuration.yaml``.
You can't mix these two methods - your initial choice determines how you should update
these settings later. If you want to switch configuration methods you will need to
uninstall and reinstall pyscript.

Pyscript has two optional configuration parameters that allow any Python package to be
imported and exposes the ``hass`` variable as a global (both options default to ``false``).
Assuming you didn't use the UI to configure pyscript, these can be set
in ``<config>/configuration.yaml``:

.. code:: yaml

   pyscript:
     allow_all_imports: true
     hass_is_global: true

It is recommended you put your pyscript configuration its own ``yaml`` file in the ``pyscript``
folder. That way changes to the file will be automatically detected and will trigger a reload,
which includes rereading the configuration parameters:

.. code:: yaml

   pyscript: !include pyscript/config.yaml

The settings and behavior of your code can be controlled by additional user-defined yaml
configuration settings. If you configured pyscript using the UI flow, you can still
add additional configuration settings via yaml. Since they are free-form (no fixed
schema) there is no UI configuration available for these additional settings.

Each application should have its configuration stored using the application's name under
an ``apps`` entry. For example, applications ``my_app1`` and ``my_app2`` would be configured
as:

.. code:: yaml

   pyscript:
     allow_all_imports: true
     apps:
       my_app1:
         # any settings for my_app1 go here
       my_app2:
         # any settings for my_app2 go here

If the include above is used, the ``pyscript/config.yaml`` would look like:

.. code:: yaml

   allow_all_imports: true
   apps:
     my_app1:
       # any settings for my_app1 go here
     my_app2:
       # any settings for my_app2 go here

The ``apps`` section could also include other configuration files if you prefer to put
each application's configuration in its own file.

An application will not be loaded unless it has a configuration entry (even if it is empty).
That provides an easy way to enable or disable an application.

An application's configuration (e.g., all the settings below ``my_app1`` in the example above)
are available in the variable ``pyscript.app_config`` in the global scope of the application's
main file (e.g., ``apps/my_app1.py`` or ``apps/my_app1/__init__.py``).  Additionally, all the pyscript
configuration settings are available via the variable ``pyscript.config``, which also includes
all the application configuration below the ``apps`` key. However, in a future release the
``apps`` entry will be removed so that apps do not have access to another app's configuration
(which might include token, passwords, or keys).  See `this section <#accessing-yaml-configuration>`__
for more information.  Note that ``pyscript.app_config`` is not defined in regular scripts, only
in each application's main file.

Note that if you used the UI flow to configure pyscript, the ``allow_all_imports`` and
``hass_is_global`` configuration settings will be ignored in the yaml file. In that case,
you should omit them from the yaml, and just use yaml for pyscript app configuration.

At startup, pyscript loads the following files. It also automatically unloads and reloads
them when changed, renamed, created, or deleted:

``<config>/pyscript/*.py``
  all files with a ``.py`` suffix in the top-level directory are autoloaded.

``<config>/pyscript/scripts/**/*.py``
  all files with a ``.py`` suffix below the ``scripts`` directory, recursively to any depth,
  are autoloaded. This is useful for organizing your scripts into subdirectories that are
  related in some way.

``<config>/pyscript/apps/<app_name>/__init__.py``
  every ``__init__.py`` file in a subdirectory in the ``apps`` subdirectory is autoloaded,
  provided ``app_name`` exists in the pyscript ``yaml`` configuration under ``apps``.
  This package form is convenient for sharing pyscript code because all the files for
  one application are stored in their own directory.

``<config>/pyscript/apps/<app_name>.py``
  all files in the ``apps`` subdirectory with a ``.py`` suffix are autoloaded, unless the
  package form above was loaded instead, and provided ``app_name`` exists in the pyscript
  ``yaml`` configuration under ``apps`` (this allows each app to be disabled by simply
  removing its configuration and reloading).

The idea is that the top-level directory ``pyscript`` and ``pyscript/scripts`` are for your own use
(and are always loaded), and ``pyscript/apps/`` is for things you've gotten from others or things
you've written with the intent to reuse or share (and only are loaded if there is a configuration
entry, which can be empty).

Any filename that starts with ``#`` is not loaded, and similarly, scripts anywhere below a directory
name that starts with ``#``, are not loaded. That's a convenient way to disable a specific script or
entire directory below ``scripts``. Simply rename it with or without the leading ``#`` to disable or
enable it (respectively), which automatically triggers a reload. Think of it as "commenting" the
filename, rather than having to delete it or move it outside the pyscript directory.

Like regular Python, functions within one source file can call each other and can share global
variables (if necessary), but just within that one file. Each file has its own separate global
context. Each Jupyter session also has its own separate global context, so functions, triggers,
variables, and services defined in each interactive session are isolated from the script files and
other Jupyter sessions. Pyscript provides some utility functions to switch global contexts, which
allows an interactive Jupyter session to interact directly with functions and global variables
created by a script file, or even another Jupyter session.

The optional ``<config>/pyscript/modules`` subdirectory can contain modules (files with a ``.py``
extension) or packages (directories that contain at least a ``__init__.py`` file) that can be
imported by any other pyscript files, applications, or modules. The module form is ignored if the
package form is present. They are not autoloaded. Any modules or packages in
``<config>/pyscript/modules`` that are modified will be unloaded when they are modified and any
scripts or apps that depend on those modules will be reloaded. Importing modules and packages from
``<config>/pyscript/modules`` are not restricted if ``allow_all_imports`` is ``False``. Typically
common functions or features would be implemented in a module or package, and then imported and used
by scripts in ``<config>/pyscript`` or applications in ``<config>/pyscript/apps``.

Even if you can't directly call one function from another script file, HASS state variables are
global and services can be called from any script file.

Reloading Scripts
-----------------

Manually reloading scripts via the ``pyscript.reload`` service is no longer necessary starting
in 1.2.0, since changes are automatically detected and a reload is triggered.

By default, calling the reload service only reloads scripts, apps, or modules that have changed since
they were last loaded. A change means the script, app or module file contents or modification time
has changed.  Additionally, an app is considered changed if its yaml configuration has changed. When
a change is detected, additional files are also reloaded if they depend on a changed file.
Additional files include all other files in a particular module or app (meaning the entire module or
app is reloaded if any of its files or imports are changed), and if a module has changed, any other
module, app or script that imports that module directly or indirectly is reloaded too.

A file is also considered changed if it is newly created or deleted (or "commented" by renaming it
or a parent directory to start with ``#``). When reload detects a deleted file, the prior global
context and all its triggers are deleted, just as when a file has changed.

If you want to reload a specific script or file, you can ``touch`` it to change its modification time.
Alternatively, the ``pyscript.reload`` service takes an optional parameter ``global_ctx`` which specifies
the name of a specific global context to reload. That is the one file considered to be changed by ``reload``,
and other changes are ignored. For example, specifying ``file.example`` will just reload
``example.py``, and ``apps.my_app1`` will just reload ``apps/my_app1.py``. See the `Global Context
<#global-context>`__ section for the mapping of file or app names to global context names.
Additional files might still be reloaded too (all other files in the module or app, and any
modules, apps or scripts that import a module if ``global_ctx`` was set to a module).

If you want to manually reload all scripts, apps and modules, set ``global_ctx`` to ``*`` when
you call ``pyscript.reload``.  Alternatively, the ``Reload`` option from the overflow menu
(button with three dots) next to pyscript in the Settings -> Devices & services -> Integrations
page will always do a full reload.

Any function definitions, services and triggers in the reloaded files are re-created. Jupyter
sessions are not affected. Any currently running functions (i.e., functions that have been triggered
and are actively executing Python code or waiting inside ``task.sleep()`` or ``task.wait_until()``)
are not stopped on reload - they continue to run until they finish (return). You can terminate
these running functions too on reload if you wish by calling ``task.unique()`` in the script
file preamble (i.e., outside any function definition), so it is executed on load and reload, which
will terminate any running functions that have previously called ``task.unique()`` with the same
argument.

State Variables
---------------

These are typically called entities or ``entity_id`` in HASS.

State variables can be accessed in any Python code simply by name. State variables (also called
``entity_id``) are of the form ``DOMAIN.name``, where ``DOMAIN`` is typically the name of the
component that sets that variable. You can set a state variable by assigning to it.

State variables only have string values, so you will need to convert them to ``int`` or ``float``
if you need their numeric value.

State variables have attributes that can be accessed by adding the name of the attribute, as in
``DOMAIN.name.attr``. The attribute names and their meaning depend on the component that sets them,
so you will need to look at the State tab in the Developer Tools to see the available attributes.
You can set an attribute directly by assigning ``DOMAIN.name.attr = value``.

In cases where you need to compute the name of the state variable dynamically, or you need to set or
get all the state attributes, you can use the built-in functions ``state.get()``, ``state.getattr()``,
``state.set()`` and ``state.setattr()``; see `State Functions <#state-variable-functions>`__.

The function ``state.names(domain=None)`` returns a list of all state variable names (i.e.,
``entity_id``\ s) of a domain. If ``domain`` is not specified, it returns all HASS state
variable (entity) names.

Also, service names (which are called as functions) take priority over state variable names, so if a
component has a state variable name that collides with one of its services, you'll need to use
``state.get(name)`` to access that state variable.

Accessing state variables that don't exist will throw a ``NameError`` exception, and accessing
an attribute that doesn't exist will throw an ``AttributeError`` exception. One exception (!)
to this is that in a ``@state_trigger`` expression, undefined state variables and attributes will
evaluate to ``None`` instead of throwing an exception.

You can assign a state variable (or the return value of ``state.get()``) to a normal Python variable,
and that variable will capture the value and attributes of the state variable at the time of the
assignment. So, for example, after this assignment:

.. code:: python

   test1_state = binary_sensor.test1

the variable ``test1_state`` captures both the value and attributes of ``binary_sensor.test1``.
Later, if ``binary_sensor.test1`` changes, ``test1_state`` continues to represent the previous
value and attributes at the time of the assignment.

State variables also support virtual methods that are service calls with that ``entity_id``.
For any state variable ``DOMAIN.ENTITY``, any services registered by ``DOMAIN``, e.g.,
``DOMAIN.SERVICE``, that have an ``entity_id`` parameter can be called as a method
``DOMAIN.ENTITY.SERVICE()``. Each of these statements are equivalent:

.. code:: python

   service.call("DOMAIN", "SERVICE", entity_id="DOMAIN.ENTITY", other_param=123)
   DOMAIN.SERVICE(entity_id="DOMAIN.ENTITY", other_param=123)
   DOMAIN.ENTITY.SERVICE(other_param=123)

In the case the service has only one other parameter in addition to ``entity_id``, a further
shorthand is that the method can be called with just a positional, rather than keyword, argument.
So if the service only takes two parameters, ``entity_id`` and ``other_param``, this additional
form is equivalent to each of the above statements:

.. code:: python

   DOMAIN.ENTITY.SERVICE(123)

Here's an example using ``input_number``, assuming it has been configured to create an entity
``input_number.test``. These statements all do the same thing (and the last one works because
``set_value`` only takes one other parameter):

.. code:: python

   service.call("input_number", "set_value", entity_id="input_number.test", value=13)
   input_number.set_value(entity_id="input_number.test", value=13)
   input_number.test.set_value(value=13)
   input_number.test.set_value(13)

Three additional virtual attribute values are available when you use a variable directly as
``DOMAIN.entity.attr`` or call ``state.get("DOMAIN.entity.attr")``:

- ``entity_id`` is the DOMAIN.entity as string
- ``last_changed`` is the last UTC time the state value was changed (not the attributes)
- ``last_updated`` is the last UTC time the state entity was updated

If you need to compute how many seconds ago the ``binary_sensor.test1`` state changed, you could
do this:

.. code:: python

   from datetime import datetime as dt
   from datetime import timezone as timezone

   num_seconds_ago = (dt.now(tz=timezone.utc) - binary_sensor.test1.last_changed).total_seconds()

Note that these virtual attributes and methods take precedence over any entity attributes that
have the same name. If an entity has attributes with those names and you need to access them,
use ``state.getattr(name)``.

Calling services
----------------

Any service can be called by using the service name as a function, with keyword parameters to
specify the service parameters. You'll need to look up the service in the Service tab of Developer
Tools to find the exact name and parameters. For example, inside any function you can call:

.. code:: python

       myservice.flash_light(light_name="front", light_color="red")

which calls the ``myservice.flash_light`` service with the indicated parameters. Obviously those
parameter values could be any Python expression, and this call could be inside a loop, an if
statement or any other Python code.

Starting in HASS 2023.7, services can return a response, which is a dictionary of values. You need
to set the keyword parameter ``return_response=True`` to get the response.  For example:

.. code:: python

       service_response = myservice.flash_light(light_name="front", light_color="red", return_response=True)

The function ``service.call(domain, name, **kwargs)`` can also be used to call a service when you
need to compute the domain or service name dynamically. For example, the above service could also be
called by:

.. code:: python

       service.call("myservice", "flash_light", light_name="front", light_color="red")

When making a service call, either using the ``service.call`` function or the service name as the
function, you can optionally pass the keyword argument ``blocking=True`` if you would like to wait
for the service to finish execution before continuing execution in your function. If the service
returns a response (new feature starting in HASS 2023.7), it will be returned by the call if you set
the optional keyword parameter ``return_response=True``.

Firing events
-------------

Any event can be triggered by calling ``event.fire(event_type, **kwargs)``. It takes the
``event_type`` as a first argument, and any keyword parameters as the event parameters. The
``event_type`` could be a user-defined string, or it could be one of the built-in events. You can
access the names of those built-in events by importing from ``homeassistant.const``, e.g.,

.. code:: python

   from homeassistant.const import EVENT_CALL_SERVICE

Function Trigger Decorators
---------------------------

There are four decorators for defining state, time, event and MQTT triggers, and two decorators for
defining whether any trigger actually causes the function to run (i.e., is active), based on
state-based expressions or one or more time-windows. The decorators should appear immediately before
the function they refer to. A single function can have any or all of the decorator types specified.
Multiple trigger decorators of the same type can be added to a single function, but only one
``@state_active``, ``@time_active`` or ``@task_unique`` can be used per function.

A Python function with decorators is still a normal Python function that can be called by any other
Python function. The decorators have no effect in the case where you call it directly from another
function.

@state_trigger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    @state_trigger(str_expr, ..., state_hold=None, state_hold_false=None, state_check_now=False, kwargs=None, watch=None)

``@state_trigger`` takes one or more string arguments that contain any expression based on one or
more state variables, and evaluates to ``True`` or ``False`` (or non-zero or zero). Whenever any of
the state variables or attribute values mentioned in the expression change (or specified via the
``watch`` argument), the expression is evaluated and the trigger occurs if it evaluates to ``True``
(or non-zero). For each state variable, e.g., ``domain.name``, the prior value is also available to
the expression as ``domain.name.old`` in case you want to condition the trigger on the prior value
too. Attribute values can be used in the expression too, using the forms ``domain.name.attr`` and
``domain.name.old.attr`` for the new and old attribute values respectively.

Multiple ``str_expr`` arguments are logically "or"ed together into a single expression. Any argument
can alternatively be a list or set of strings, and they are treated the same as multiple arguments
by "or"ing them together. Alternatively, independent state triggers can be specified by using
multiple ``@state_trigger`` decorators.

Optional arguments are:

``state_check_now=False``
  If set, the ``@state_trigger`` expression is evaluated immediately when the trigger function
  is defined (typically at startup), and the trigger occurs if the expression evaluates
  to ``True`` or non-zero. Normally the expression is only evaluated when a state variable
  changes, and not when the trigger function is first defined. This option is the same as
  in the ``task.wait_until`` function, except the default value is ``True`` in that case.
  Note that if you specify ``state_check_now=True``, entries in ``state_trigger`` that are
  plain state variable names (which mean trigger on any change) are ignored during the initial
  check - only expressions are checked.

``state_hold=None``
  A numeric duration in seconds that delays executing the trigger function for this amount of time.
  If the state trigger expression changes back to ``False`` during that time, the trigger is
  canceled and a wait for a new trigger begins. If the state trigger expression changes, but is
  still ``True`` then the ``state_hold`` time is not restarted - the trigger will still occur
  that number of seconds after the first state trigger.

``state_hold_false=None``
  If set, the state trigger edge is triggered (triggers on a ``False`` to ``True`` transition),
  versus the default of level triggered (triggers when ``True``). The ``@state_trigger`` expression
  must evaluate to ``False`` for this duration in seconds before the next trigger can occur.
  A value of ``0`` requires the expression be ``False`` before a trigger, but with no minimum
  time in that state. If the expression evaluates to ``True`` during the ``state_hold_false`` period,
  that trigger is ignored, and when the expression next is ``False`` the ``state_hold_false`` period
  starts over.

  For example, by default the expression ``"int(sensor.temp_outside) >= 50"`` will trigger every
  time ``sensor.temp_outside`` changes to a value that is 50 or more. If instead ``state_hold_false=0``,
  the trigger will only occur when ``sensor.temp_outside`` changes the first time to 50 or more.
  It has to go back below 50 for ``state_hold_false`` seconds before a new trigger can occur.

  When ``state_hold_false`` is set, the state trigger expression is evaluated at startup. If ``False``
  the ``state_hold_false`` period begins. If ``True``, a wait for the next ``False`` value begins.
  If ``state_check_now`` is also set, the trigger will also occur at startup if the expression is
  ``True`` at startup, while the ``state_hold_false`` logic will continue to wait until the expression
  is ``False`` for that period before the next future trigger.

``kwargs=None``
  Additional keyword arguments can be passed to the trigger function by setting ``kwargs`` to a dict
  of additional keywords and values. These will override the standard keyword arguments such as
  ``value`` or ``var_name`` if you include those keywords in ``kwargs``. A typical use for
  ``kwargs`` is if you have multiple ``@state_trigger`` decorators on a single trigger function
  and you want to pass additional parameters (based on the trigger, such as a setting or action)
  to the function.  That could save several lines of code in the function determining which trigger
  occurred.

``watch=None``
  Specifies a list or set of string state variable names (entity names) or state attributes that are
  monitored for this trigger.  When (and only when) a variable in this set changes, the trigger
  expression is evaluated. Normally this set of names is automatically extracted from the
  ``@state_trigger`` expression, but there could be cases where it doesn't capture all the names
  (e.g., if you have to use ``state.get()`` inside the trigger expression). You could also use
  ``watch`` to specify a subset of the names in the trigger expression, which has the effect of
  rendering those other variables as only conditions in the trigger expression that won't cause
  a trigger themselves, since the expression won't be evaluated when they change.

Here's a summary of the trigger behavior with these parameter settings:

=================== ==================== ================= ========================
``state_check_now`` ``state_hold_false`` trigger at start? trigger on state change?
=================== ==================== ================= ========================
default (``False``) default (``None``)   no                if expr ``True``
default (``False``) 0                    no                if expr ``True``, only after ``False``
default (``False``) 10                   no                if expr ``True``, only after ``False`` for |geq| 10 sec
``True``            default (``None``)   if expr ``True``  if expr ``True``
``True``            0                    if expr ``True``  if expr ``True``, only after ``False``
``True``            10                   if expr ``True``  if expr ``True``, only after ``False`` for |geq| 10 sec
=================== ==================== ================= ========================

If ``state_hold`` is also specified, all the entries in the table that say "if expr ``True``"
must remain ``True`` for that number of seconds for the trigger to occur.

All state variables in HASS have string values. So you'll have to do comparisons against string
values or cast the variable to an integer or float. These two examples are essentially equivalent
(note the use of single quotes inside the outer double quotes):

.. code:: python

   @state_trigger("domain.light_level == '255' or domain.light2_level == '0'")

.. code:: python

   @state_trigger("int(domain.light_level) == 255 or int(domain.light2_level) == 0")

although the second will throw an exception if the variable string doesn't represent a valid integer.
If you want numerical inequalities you should use the second form, since string lexicographic
ordering is not the same as numeric ordering.

You can also use state variable attributes in the trigger expression, with an identifier of the
form ``DOMAIN.name.attr``. Attributes maintain their original type, so there is no need to cast
then to another type.

You can specify a state trigger on any change with a string that can take three forms:

- ``"domain.entity"``: triggers on any change to the state variable value
- ``"domain.entity.attr"``: triggers on any change to the state variable attribute ``attr`` value
- ``"domain.entity.*"``: triggers on any change to any state variable attribute (but not its value)

For example:

.. code:: python

   @state_trigger("domain.light_level")

will trigger any time the value of ``domain.light_level`` changes (not its attributes), which
includes the cases when that variable is first created (i.e., the ``old_value`` is ``None``)
and when it is deleted (i.e., the ``value`` is ``None``).

If you use the "any change" form, there's no point in also specifying ``state_hold`` since the
expression is always ``True`` whenever the state variable changes - there is no way for it to
evaluate to ``False`` and to re-start the trigger process. If you do specify ``state_hold`` in
this case it will simply delay the trigger by the specified time.

The trigger can include arguments with any mixture of string expressions (that are evaluated
when any of the underlying state variables change) and string state variable or attribute
names (that trigger whenever that variable or attribute changes).

Note that if a state variable and attributes are set to the same value, HASS doesn't generate a
state change event, so the ``@state_trigger`` condition will not be checked. It is only evaluated
each time a state variable or any of its attributes change to a new value.

When the trigger occurs and the function is executed (meaning any active checks passed too), keyword
arguments are passed to the function so it can tell which state variable caused it to succeed and
run, in cases where the trigger condition involves multiple variables. These are:

.. code:: python

   kwargs = {
       "trigger_type": "state",
       "var_name": var_name,
       "value": new_value,
       "old_value": old_value
   }

The ``value`` and ``old_value`` represent the current and old values of the state variable
``var_name`` whose change caused the trigger. Those variables include the state attributes too.
If the trigger occurs when the state variable is newly created, ``old_value`` will be ``None``,
and if the trigger occurs when a state variable is deleted, ``value`` will be ``None``.

Additional keyword parameters can be passed to the trigger function by setting the optional
``kwargs`` parameter to a ``dict`` with the keyword/value pairs.

If your function needs to know any of these values, you can list the keyword arguments you need,
with defaults:

.. code:: python

   @state_trigger("domain.light_level == '255' or domain.light2_level == '0'")
   def light_turned_on(trigger_type=None, var_name=None, value=None):
       pass

You don't have to list all the default keyword parameters - just the ones your function needs.
In contrast, if you specify additional keyword parameters via ``kwargs``, you will get an excepton
if the function doesn't have matching keyword arguments (unless you use the ``**kwargs`` catch-all
in the function definition).

Using ``trigger_type`` is helpful if you have multiple trigger decorators. The function can now tell
which type of trigger, and which of the two variables changed to cause the trigger. You can also use
the keyword catch-all declaration instead:

.. code:: python

   @state_trigger("domain.light_level == '255' or domain.light2_level == '0'")
   def light_turned_on(**kwargs):
       log.info(f"got arguments {kwargs}")

and all those values (including optional ones you specify with the ``kwargs`` argument to
``@state_trigger``) will simply get passed via ``kwargs`` as a ``dict``. That's the most useful form
to use if you have multiple decorators, since each one passes different variables into the function
(although all of them set ``trigger_type``).

If ``state_check_now`` is set to ``True`` and the trigger occurs during its immediate check, since
there is no underlying state variable change, the trigger function is called with only this argument:

.. code:: python

   kwargs = {
       "trigger_type": "state",
   }

If the trigger function uses ``var_name==None`` as a keyword argument, it can check if it is ``None``
to determine whether it was called immediately or not. Similarly, if it uses the ``kwargs``
form, if can check if ``var_name`` is in ``kwargs``.

If ``state_hold`` is specified, the arguments to the trigger function reflect the variable change
that cause the first trigger, not any subsequent ones during the ``state_hold`` period. Also, if
the ``@time_active`` or ``@state_active`` decorators are used, they will be evaluated after the
``state_hold`` period, but with the initial trigger variable value (i.e., the value that caused
the initial trigger).

Inside ``str_expr``, undefined state variables, undefined state attributes, and undefined
``.old`` variables evaluate to ``None``, rather than throwing an exception. The ``.old`` variable will
be ``None`` the first time the state variable is set (since it has no prior value), and when the
``str_expr`` is being evaluated because a different state variable changed (only the state variable
change that caused ``str_expr`` to be evaluated gets its prior value in ``.old``; any other ``.old``
variables will be ``None`` for that evaluation).

@time_trigger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    @time_trigger(time_spec, ..., kwargs=None)

``@time_trigger`` takes one or more string specifications that specify time-based triggers. When
multiple time triggers are specified, each are evaluated, and the earliest one is the next trigger.
Then the process repeats. Alternatively, multiple time trigger specifications can be specified by using
multiple ``@time_trigger`` decorators, although that is less efficient than passing multiple arguments
to a single one.

Additional keyword parameters can be passed to the trigger function by setting the optional
``kwargs`` parameter to a ``dict`` with the keywords and values.

Several of the time specifications use a ``datetime`` format, which is ISO: ``yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss``,
with the following features:

- There is no time-zone (local is assumed).
- The date is optional, and the year can be omitted with just ``mm/dd``.
- The date can also be replaced by a day of the week (either full like ``sunday`` or 3-letters like
  ``sun``, in your local language based on the locale; however, on Windows and other platforms that
  lack ``locale.nl_langinfo``, the days of week default to English).
- The meaning of partial or missing dates depends on the trigger, as explained below.
- The date and time can be replaced with ``now``, which means the current date and time when the
  trigger was first evaluated (e.g., at startup or when created as an inner function or closure),
  and remains fixed for the lifetime of the trigger.
- The time can instead be ``sunrise``, ``sunset``, ``noon`` or ``midnight``.
- If the time is missing, midnight is assumed (so ``thursday`` is the same as ``thursday 00:00:00``)
- Seconds are optional, and can include a decimal (fractional) portion if you need finer resolution.
- The ``datetime`` can be followed by an optional offset
  of the form ``[+-]number{seconds|minutes|hours|days|weeks}`` with abbreviations:

  - ``{s|sec|second|seconds}`` or empty for seconds,
  - ``{m|min|mins|minute|minutes}`` for minutes,
  - ``{h|hr|hour|hours}`` for hours,
  - ``{d|day|days}`` for days,
  - ``{w|week|weeks}`` for weeks.

  That allows things like ``sunrise + 30m`` to mean 30 minutes after sunrise, or ``sunday sunset - 1.5 hour``
  to mean 1.5 hours before sunset on Sundays. The ``number`` can be floating point. (Note, there is no
  i18n support for those offset abbreviations - they are in English.)

In ``@time_trigger``, each string specification ``time_spec`` can take one of five forms:

- ``"startup"`` triggers on HASS start and reload (i.e., on function definition), and is
  equivalent to ``"once(now)"``
- ``"shutdown"`` triggers on HASS shutdown and reload (i.e., when the trigger function is
  no longer referenced)
- ``"once(datetime)"`` triggers once on the date and time. If the year is
  omitted, it triggers once per year on the date and time (e.g., birthday). If the date is just a day
  of week, it triggers once on that day of the week. If the date is omitted, it triggers once each
  day at the indicated time. ``once(now + 5 min)`` means trigger once 5 minutes after startup.
- ``"period(datetime_start, interval, datetime_end)"`` or
  ``"period(datetime_start, interval)"`` triggers every interval starting at the starting datetime
  and finishing at the optional ending datetime. When there is no ending datetime, the periodic
  trigger runs forever. The interval has the form ``number{sec|min|hours|days|weeks}`` (the same as
  datetime offset without the leading sign), and the same abbreviations can be used. Period start
  and ends can also be based on ``now``, for example ``period(now + 10m, 5min, now + 30min)`` will
  cause five triggers at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes after startup.
- ``"cron(min hr dom mon dow)"`` triggers according to Linux-style crontab. Each of the five entries
  are separated by spaces and correspond to minutes, hours, day-of-month, month, day-of-week (0 = sunday):

  ============ ==============
  field        allowed values
  ============ ==============
  minute       0-59
  hour         0-23
  day of month 1-31
  month        1-12
  day of week  0-6 (0 is Sun)
  ============ ==============

  Each field can be a ``*`` (which means "all"), a single number, a range or comma-separated list of
  numbers or ranges (no spaces). Ranges are inclusive. For example, if you specify hours as
  ``6,10-13`` that means hours of 6,10,11,12,13. The trigger happens on the next minute, hour, day
  that matches the specification. See any Linux documentation for examples and more details (note:
  names for days of week and months are not supported; only their integer values are). The cron
  features use the ``croniter`` package, so check its `documentation <https://pypi.org/project/croniter/>`__
  for additional specification formats that are supported (e.g., ``*/5`` repeats every 5th unit,
  days of week can be specified with English abbreviations, and an optional 6th field allows seconds
  to be specified).

When the ``@time_trigger`` occurs and the function is called, the keyword argument ``trigger_type``
is set to ``"time"``, and ``trigger_time`` is the exact ``datetime`` of the time specification that
caused the trigger (it will be slightly before the current time), or ``startup`` or ``shutdown``
in the case of a ``startup`` or ``shutdown`` trigger.

Additional optional keyword parameters can be specified in the ``kwargs`` parameter to ``@time_trigger``.

A final special form of ``@time_trigger`` has no arguments, which causes the function to run once
automatically on startup or reload, which is the same as providing a single ``"startup"`` time
specification:

.. code:: python

   @time_trigger
   def run_on_startup_or_reload():
       """This function runs automatically once on startup or reload"""
       pass

The function is not re-started after it returns, unless a reload occurs. Startup occurs when the
``EVENT_HOMEASSISTANT_STARTED`` event is fired, which is after everything else is initialized and
ready, so this function can call any services etc. A startup trigger can also occur after
HASS is started when a new trigger function is defined (e.g., on reload, defined at run-time
using inner function/closure, or interactively in Jupyter).

Similarly, the ``shutdown`` trigger occurs when the ``EVENT_HOMEASSISTANT_STOP`` event is fired,
meaning HASS is shutting down. It also occurs whenever a trigger function is no longer referenced
(meaning it's being deleted), which happens during reload or redefined interactively in Jupyter.
It's important that any trigger function based on ``shutdown`` runs as quickly as possible,
since the shutdown of HASS (or reload completion) will be stalled until your function
completes.

Note that ``period`` and ``cron`` behave differently as daylight savings changes occur.  The
``datetime`` values are always in local time.  The ``interval`` in the ``period()`` trigger is
always the same duration, even when it crosses a daylight saving time change.  For example, if
the starting time is 6:00pm on some day in summer, and the interval is 1 day, the triggers will
occur at 6:00pm in summer and 5:00pm in winter; they are always exactly 24 hours apart.  In
contrast, if ``cron()`` specifies a daily trigger at a specific time of day, the interval between
triggers will be 23 or 25 hours when it crosses a daylight saving time change, so that the trigger
continues to be at the specific time of day according to the ``cron()`` specification.  For example,
if the ``cron()`` specification is ``"0 18 * * *"`` (6:00pm every day), the triggers will occur at
6:00pm every day, even when the time changes from summer to winter or vice versa.

This can create some surprising behavior when the ``cron()`` specification is for a time that lands
in the middle of the repeated or skipped hour when daylight saving time changes.  For example, if
the ``cron()`` specification is ``"1 1-4 * * *"`` (1:01am, 2:01am, 3:01am, 4:01am every day), when
the transition from summer to winter time occurs, the triggers will occur at 1:01am, 2:01am, 3:01am,
4:01am, but the 2:01am trigger will occur 2 hours after the 1:01am trigger.  When the transition
from winter to summer time occurs, the triggers will occur at 1:01am, 3:01am, 4:01am, and the 3:01am
trigger will occur 1 hour after the 1:01am trigger.

@event_trigger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    @event_trigger(event_type, str_expr=None, kwargs=None)

``@event_trigger`` triggers on the given ``event_type``. Multiple ``@event_trigger`` decorators
can be applied to a single function if you want to trigger the same function with different event
types.

An optional ``str_expr`` can be used to match the event data, and the trigger will only occur if
that expression evaluates to ``True`` or non-zero. This expression has available all the event
parameters sent with the event, together with these two variables:

- ``trigger_type`` is set to "event"
- ``event_type`` is the string event type, which will be the same as the
  first argument to ``@event_trigger``

Note, unlike state variables, the event data values are not forced to be strings, so typically that
data has its native type.

When the ``@event_trigger`` occurs, those same variables are passed as keyword arguments to the
function in case it needs them.  Additional keyword parameters can be specified by setting the
optional ``kwargs`` argument to a ``dict`` with the keywords and values.

The ``event_type`` could be a user-defined string, or it could be one of the built-in events. You
can access the names of those events by importing from ``homeassistant.const``, e.g.,

.. code:: python

   from homeassistant.const import EVENT_CALL_SERVICE

To figure out what parameters are sent with an event and what objects (e.g., ``list``, ``dict``) are
used to represent them, you can look at the HASS source code, or initially use the ``**kwargs``
argument to capture all the parameters and log them. For example, you might want to trigger on
certain service calls (not ones directed to pyscript), but you are unsure which one, and what
parameters it has. So initially you trigger on all service calls just to see them:

.. code:: python

   from homeassistant.const import EVENT_CALL_SERVICE

   @event_trigger(EVENT_CALL_SERVICE)
   def monitor_service_calls(**kwargs):
       log.info(f"got EVENT_CALL_SERVICE with kwargs={kwargs}")

After running that, you see that you are interested in the service call ``lights.turn_on``, and you
see that the ``EVENT_CALL_SERVICE`` event has parameters ``domain`` set to ``lights`` and
``service`` set to ``turn_on``, and the service parameters are passed as a ``dict`` in
``service_data``. So then you can narrow down the event trigger to that particular service call:

.. code:: python

   from homeassistant.const import EVENT_CALL_SERVICE

   @event_trigger(EVENT_CALL_SERVICE, "domain == 'lights' and service == 'turn_on'")
   def monitor_light_turn_on_service(service_data=None):
       log.info(f"lights.turn_on service called with service_data={service_data}")

This `wiki page <https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript/wiki/Event-based-triggers>`__ gives
more examples of built-in and user events and how to create triggers for them.

@mqtt_trigger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    @mqtt_trigger(topic, str_expr=None, kwargs=None)

``@mqtt_trigger`` subscribes to the given MQTT ``topic`` and triggers whenever a message is received
on that topic. Multiple ``@mqtt_trigger`` decorators can be applied to a single function if you want
to trigger off different mqtt topics.

An optional ``str_expr`` can be used to match the MQTT message data, and the trigger will only occur
if that expression evaluates to ``True`` or non-zero. This expression has available these
variables:

- ``trigger_type`` is set to "mqtt"
- ``topic`` is set to the topic the message was received on
- ``qos`` is set to the message QoS.
- ``payload`` is set to the string payload of the message
- ``payload_obj`` if the payload was valid JSON, this will be set to the native Python object
  representing that payload.  A null message will not be converted.  If payload_obj is a
  required function argument an exception will be thrown, use payload_obj=None.

When the ``@mqtt_trigger`` occurs, those same variables are passed as keyword arguments to the
function in case it needs them. Additional keyword parameters can be specified by setting the
optional ``kwargs`` argument to a ``dict`` with the keywords and values.

Wildcards in topics are supported. The ``topic`` variables will be set to the full expanded topic
the message arrived on.

Wildcards are:

- ``+`` matches a single level in the topic hierarchy.
- ``#`` matches zero or more levels in the topic hierarchy, can only be last.

NOTE: The `MQTT Integration in Home Assistant <https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/>`__
must be set up to use ``@mqtt_trigger``.

.. code:: python

  @mqtt_trigger('zigbee2mqtt/motion.carport', "payload_obj['occupancy'] != None")
  @time_active("range(sunset - 30m, sunrise - 30m)")
  def carport_motion():
      light.turn_on(entity_id="light.carport")
      task.sleep(300)
      light.turn_off(entity_id="light.carport")

@state_active
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    @state_active(str_expr)

When any trigger occurs (whether time, state or event), the ``@state_active`` expression is
evaluated. If it evaluates to ``False`` (or zero), the trigger is ignored and the trigger function
is not called. Only a single ``@state_active`` decorator can be used per function - you can combine
multiple conditions into ``str_expr`` using ``any``, ``all``, or logical operators like ``or`` or ``and``.

This decorator is roughly equivalent to starting the trigger function with an
``if`` statement with the ``str_expr`` (the minor difference is that this decorator uses the
``@state_trigger`` variable value, if present, when evaluating ``str_expr``, whereas an
``if`` statement at the start of the function uses its current value, which might be different
if the state variable was changed immediately after the trigger, and the ``.old`` value is
not available).

If the trigger was caused by ``@state_trigger``, the prior value of the state variable that
caused the trigger is available to ``str_expr`` with a ``.old`` suffix.

Inside the ``str_expr``, undefined state variables, undefined state attributes, and undefined
``.old`` variables evaluate to ``None``, rather than throwing an exception. Any ``.old`` variable
will be ``None`` if the trigger is not a state trigger, if a different state variable change
caused the state trigger, or if the state variable that caused the trigger was set for the
first time (so there is no prior value).

.. code:: python

   @state_trigger("binary_sensor.motion_detected == 'on'")  # trigger on motion detection
   @state_active("input_boolean.motion_light_automation == 'on'")  # but only if the automation is enabled
   def motion_controlled_light(**kwargs):
       log.info(f"got motion. turning on the lights")
       light.turn_on(entity_id="light.hallway")



@time_active
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    @time_active(time_spec, ..., hold_off=None)

``@time_active`` takes zero or more strings that specify time-based ranges. Only a single
``@time_active`` decorator can be used per function. When any trigger occurs (whether time, state
or event), each time range specification is checked. If the current time doesn't fall within any
range specified, the trigger is ignored and the trigger function is not called. The optional numeric
``hold_off`` setting in seconds will ignore any triggers that are within that amount of time from
the last successful one. Think of this as making the trigger inactive for that number of seconds
immediately following each successful trigger. This can be used for rate-limiting trigger events or
debouncing a noisy sensor.

Each string specification ``time_spec`` can take two forms:

- ``"range(datetime_start, datetime_end)"`` is satisfied if the current
  time is in the indicated range, including the end points. As in ``@time_trigger``, the year or
  date can be omitted to specify daily ranges. If the end is prior to the start, the range is
  satisfied if the current time is either greater than or equal to the start or less than or equal
  to the end. That allows a range like: ``@time_active("range(sunset - 20min, sunrise + 15min)")``
  to mean at least 20 minutes before sunset, or at least 15 minutes after sunrise (note: at
  latitudes close to the polar circles, there can be cases where the sunset time is after midnight,
  so it is before the sunrise time, so this might not work correctly; at even greater latitudes
  sunset and sunrise will not be defined at all since there might not be daily sunrises or sunsets).
- ``"cron(min hr dom mon dow)"`` is satisfied if the current time matches
  the range specified by the ``cron`` parameters. For example, if ``hr`` is ``6-10`` that means
  hours between 6 and 10 inclusive. If additionally ``min`` is ``*`` (i.e., any), then that would
  mean a time interval from 6:00 to immediately prior to 11:00.

Each argument specification can optionally start with ``not``, which inverts the meaning of that
range or cron specification. If you specify multiple arguments without ``not``, they are logically
or'ed together, meaning the active check is true if any of the (positive) time ranges are met. If
you have several ``not`` arguments, they are logically and'ed together, so the active check will be
true if the current time doesn't match any of the "not" (negative) specifications. ``@time_active``
allows multiple arguments with and without ``not``. The condition will be met if the current time
matches any of the positive arguments, and none of the negative arguments.

.. code:: python

   @state_trigger("binary_sensor.motion_detected == 'on'")  # trigger on motion detection
   @state_active("input_boolean.motion_light_automation == 'on'")  # but only if the automation is enabled
   @time_active("range(8:00, 22:00)")  # but only during the day
   def motion_controlled_light(**kwargs):
       log.info(f"got motion. turning on the lights")
       light.turn_on(entity_id="light.hallway")


@webhook_trigger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    @webhook_trigger(webhook_id, str_expr=None, local_only=True, methods={"POST", "PUT"}, kwargs=None)

``@webhook_trigger`` listens for calls to a `Home Assistant webhook <https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#webhook-trigger>`__ at ``your_hass_url/api/webhook/webhook_id`` and triggers whenever a request is made at that endpoint. Multiple ``@webhook_trigger`` decorators can be applied to a single function if you want to trigger off different webhook ids.

Setting ``local_only`` option to ``False`` will allow request made from anywhere on the internet (as opposed to just on local network).
The methods option needs to be an list or set with elements ``GET``, ``HEAD``, ``POST``, or ``PUT``.

An optional ``str_expr`` can be used to match against payload message data, and the trigger will only occur if that expression evaluates to ``True`` or non-zero. This expression has available these three
variables:

- ``trigger_type`` is set to "webhook"
- ``webhook_id`` is set to the webhook_id that was called.
- ``payload`` is the data/json that was sent in the request returned as a dictionary.

When the ``@webhook_trigger`` occurs, those same variables are passed as keyword arguments to the function in case it needs them. Additional keyword parameters can be specified by setting the optional ``kwargs`` argument to a ``dict`` with the keywords and values.

An simple example looks like

.. code:: python

  @webhook_trigger("myid", kwargs={"extra": 10})
  def webhook_test(payload, extra):
      log.info(f"It ran! {payload}, {extra}")

which if called using the curl command ``curl -X POST -d 'key1=xyz&key2=abc' hass_url/api/webhook/myid`` outputs ``It ran! {'key1': 'xyz', 'key2': 'abc'}, 10``

NOTE: A webhook_id can only be used by either a built-in Home Assistant automation or pyscript, but not both. Trying to use the same webhook_id in both will result in an error.

Other Function Decorators
-------------------------

@pyscript_compile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default in pyscript all functions are async, so they cannot be used in ``task.executor``,
as callbacks or methods in Python packages that expect regular functions, or used with built-in
functions like ``filter``, ``map`` or special class methods that are called by Python internals
(e.g., ``__getattr__`` or ``__del__``).

The ``@pyscript_compile`` decorator causes the function to be treated as native Python and
compiled, which results in a regular Python function being defined, and it will run at full
compiled speed. A ``lambda`` function is automatically compiled so it behaves like a regular
Python ``lambda`` function (which means the lambda function body cannot contain pyscript
features).

For example:

.. code:: python

   @pyscript_compile
   def incr(x):
       return x + 1

   x = list(map(incr, [0, 5, 10]))

sets ``x`` to ``[1, 6, 11]``.

One use for ``@pyscript_compile`` is to encapsulate functions that block (e.g., doing I/O), so they can
be called from ``task.executor``. This might be a more convenient way to create native Python functions
called by ``task.executor``, instead of moving them all to an external module or package outside
of ``config/pyscript``. This example reads a file using a native compiled function called by
``task.executor``:

.. code:: python

   @pyscript_compile
   def read_file(file_name):
       try:
           with open(file_name, encoding="utf-8") as file_desc:
              return file_desc.read(), None
       except Exception as exc:
           return None, exc

   contents, exception = task.executor(read_file, "config/configuration.yaml")
   if exception:
       raise exception
   log.info(f"contents = {contents}")

Restrictions include:

- since it's native Python, the function cannot use any pyscript-specific features;
  but since it's native Python, all language features are available, including ``open``,
  ``yield`` etc.
- if you use ``@pyscript_compile`` on an inner function (i.e., defined inside a pyscript
  function), then binding of variables defined outside the scope of the inner function
  does not work.

@pyscript_executor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``@pyscript_executor`` decorator does the same thing as ``@pyscript_compile`` and
additionally wraps the compiled function with a call to ``task.executor``. The resulting
function is now a pyscript (async) function that can be called like any other pyscript
function.  This provides the cleanest way of defining a native Python function that is
executed in a new thread each time it is called, which is required for functions that
do I/O or otherwise might block.

The file reading example above is simplified with the use of ``@pyscript_executor``:

.. code:: python

   @pyscript_executor
   def read_file(file_name):
       try:
           with open(file_name, encoding="utf-8") as file_desc:
              return file_desc.read(), None
       except Exception as exc:
           return None, exc

   contents, exception = read_file("config/configuration.yaml")
   if exception:
       raise exception
   log.info(f"contents = {contents}")

Notice that ``read_file()`` is called like a regular function, and it automatically calls
``task.executor``, which runs the compiled native Python function in a new thread, and
then returns the result.

@service(service_name, ..., supports_response="none")
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``@service`` decorator causes the function to be registered as a service so it can be called
externally. The string ``service_name`` argument is optional and defaults to ``"pyscript.FUNC_NAME"``,
where ``FUNC_NAME`` is the name of the function. You can override that default by specifying
a string with a single period of the form ``"DOMAIN.SERVICE"``. Multiple arguments and multiple
``@service`` decorators can be used to register multiple names (e.g., aliases) for the same function.

The ``supports_response`` keyword argument can be set to one of three string values: ``"none"`` (the
default), ``"only"``, or ``"optional"``, depending on whether the service provides no response, always
provides a response, or sometimes provides a response.  Services responses were added in HASS 2023.7.
The service response is a dictionary returned by the function.

Other trigger decorators like ``@state_active`` and ``@time_active`` don't affect the service.
Those still allow state, time or other triggers to be specified in addition.

The function is called with keyword parameters set to the service call parameters, plus
``trigger_type`` is set to ``"service"``. The function definition should specify all the
expected keyword arguments to match the service call parameters, or use the ``**kwargs``
argument declaration to capture all the keyword arguments.

The ``doc_string`` (the string immediately after the function declaration) is used as the service
description that appears is in the Services tab of the Developer Tools page. The function argument
names are used as the service parameter names, but there is no description.

Alternatively, if the ``doc_string`` starts with ``yaml``, the rest of the string is used as a
``yaml`` service description. Here's the first example above, with a more detailed ``doc_string``
(for a more complete example and explanation of the service description, check the Home Assistant
`developer documentation <https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/dev_101_services#service-descriptions>`__):

.. code:: python

   @service
   def hello_world(action=None, id=None):
       """yaml
   name: Service example
   description: hello_world service example using pyscript.
   fields:
     action:
        description: turn_on turns on the light, fire fires an event
        example: turn_on
        required: true
        selector:
          select:
            options:
              - turn_on
              - fire
     id:
        description: id of light, or name of event to fire
        example: kitchen.light
        required: true
        selector:
          text:
   """
       log.info(f"hello world: got action {action}")
       if action == "turn_on" and id is not None:
           light.turn_on(entity_id=id, brightness=255)
       elif action == "fire" and id is not None:
           event.fire(id)

@task_unique
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    @task_unique(task_name, kill_me=False)

This decorator is equivalent to calling ``task.unique()`` at the start of the function when that
function is triggered. Like all the decorators, if the function is called directly from another
Python function, this decorator has no effect. See `this section <#task-unique-function>`__ for more
details.

Functions
---------

Most of these have been mentioned already, but here is the complete list of additional functions
made available by ``pyscript``.

Note that even though the function names contain a period, the left portion is not a class (e.g.,
``state`` is not a class, and in fact isn't even defined). These are simply functions whose name
includes a period. This is one aspect where the interpreter behaves slightly differently from real
Python.

However, if you set a variable like ``state``, ``log`` or ``task`` to some value, then the functions
defined with that prefix will no longer be available, since the portion after the period will now be
interpreted as a method or class function acting on that variable. That's the same behavior as
Python - for example, if you set ``bytes`` to some value then the ``bytes.fromhex()`` class method
is no longer available in the current scope.

.. _State Variable Functions:

State variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

State variables can be used and set just by using them as normal Python variables. However, there
could be cases where you want to dynamically generate the variable name (e.g., in a function or loop
where the state variable name is computed dynamically). These functions allow you to get and set a
variable using its string name. The set function also allows you to optionally set the attributes,
which you can't do if you are directly assigning to the variable:

``state.delete(name)``
  Deletes the given state variable or attribute. The Python ``del`` statement can also be used
  to delete a state variable or attribute.
``state.get(name)``
  Returns the value of the state variable given its string ``name``. A ``NameError`` exception
  is thrown if the name doesn't exist. If ``name`` is a string of the form ``DOMAIN.entity.attr``
  then the attribute ``attr`` of the state variable ``DOMAIN.entity`` is returned; an
  ``AttributeError`` exception is thrown if that attribute doesn't exist.
``state.getattr(name)``
  Returns a ``dict`` of attribute values for the state variable ``name`` string, or ``None`` if it
  doesn't exist. Alternatively, ``name`` can be a state variable. In pyscript versions prior to
  1.0.0, this function was ``state.get_attr()``. That deprecated name is still supported, but it
  logs a warning message and will be removed in a future version.
``state.names(domain=None)``
  Returns a list of all state variable names (i.e., ``entity_id``\ s) of a
  domain. If ``domain`` is not specified, it returns all HASS state variable (``entity_id``) names.
``state.persist(entity_id, default_value=None, default_attributes=None)``
  Indicates that the entity ``entity_id`` should be persisted. Optionally, a default value and
  default attributes (a ``dict``) can be specified, which are applied to the entity if it doesn't
  exist or doesn't have any attributes respectively. "Persist" mean its value and attributes
  are preserved across HASS restarts. This only applies to entities in the ``pyscript``
  domain (i.e., name starts with ``pyscript.``). See `this section <#persistent-state>`__ for
  more information.
``state.set(name, value=None, new_attributes=None, **kwargs)``
  Sets the state variable to the given value, with the optional attributes. The optional 3rd
  argument, ``new_attributes``, should be a ``dict`` and it will overwrite all the existing
  attributes if specified. If instead attributes are specified using keyword arguments, then
  just those attributes will be set and other attributes will not be affected. If no optional
  arguments are provided, just the state variable value is set and the attributes are not changed.
  If no value is provided, just the state attributes are set and the value isn't changed.
  To clear all the attributes, set ``new_attributes={}``.
``state.setattr(name, value)``
  Sets a state variable attribute to the given value. The ``name`` should fully specify the
  state variable and attribute as a string in the form ``DOMAIN.entity.attr``.

Note that in HASS, all state variable values are coerced into strings. For example, if a state
variable has a numeric value, you might want to convert it to a numeric type (e.g., using ``int()``
or ``float()``). Attributes keep their native type.

Service Calls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``service.call(domain, name, blocking=False, return_response=False, **kwargs)``
  calls the service ``domain.name`` with the given keyword arguments as parameters. If ``blocking``
  is ``True``, pyscript will wait for the service to finish executing before continuing the current
  routine.  If the service returns a response, set ``return_response`` to ``True`` (which also
  causes blocking), and the response will be returned by the function call.  Note that starting
  in HASS 2023.7, the blocking timeout parameter ``limit`` is no longer supported.
``service.has_service(domain, name)``
  returns whether the service ``domain.name`` exists.

Event Firing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``event.fire(event_type, **kwargs)``
  sends an event with the given ``event_type`` string and the keyword parameters as the event data.

Logging
^^^^^^^

Five logging functions are provided, with increasing levels of severity:

``log.debug(str)``
  log a message at debug level
``log.info(str)``
  log a message at info level
``log.warning(str)``
  log a message at warning level
``log.error(str)``
  log a message at error level
``print(str)``
  same as ``log.debug(str)``; currently ``print`` doesn't support other arguments.

The ``Logger`` component can be used to specify the logging level. Log messages below the configured
level will not appear in the log. Each log message function uses a log name of the form:

.. code:: yaml

   custom_components.pyscript.file.SCRIPTNAME.FUNCNAME

where ``FUNCNAME`` is the name of the top-level Python function (e.g., the one called by a trigger
or service), defined in the script file ``SCRIPTNAME.py``. See the `Global Context <#global-context>`__
section for the logging paths for other cases.

That allows you to set the log level for each Python top-level script or function separately if necessary.
That setting also applies to any other Python functions that the top-level Python function calls.
For example, these settings:

.. code:: yaml

   logger:
     default: info
     logs:
       custom_components.pyscript.file: info
       custom_components.pyscript.file.my_script.my_function: debug

will log all messages at ``info`` or higher (i.e., ``log.info()``, ``log.warning()`` and
``log.error()``), and inside ``my_function`` defined in the script file ``my_script.py`` (and any
other functions it calls) will log all messages at ``debug`` or higher.

Note that in Jupyter, all the ``log`` functions will display output in your session, independent of
the ``logger`` configuration settings.

Changing the log level via the main configuration yaml file will typically require a restart of HASS.
To avoid that, you can set the log level for any specific logging path by calling the ``logger.set_level``
service from Jupyter, VSC, or in a ``pyscript`` script; for example:

  .. code:: python

    logger.set_level(**{"custom_components.pyscript.file.my_script": "debug"})

will change the log level for the ``my_script.py`` script to ``debug``, while:

  .. code:: python

    logger.set_level(**{"custom_components.pyscript.file.my_script.func1": "debug"})

will change the log level for the ``func1()`` function in ``my_script.py`` script to ``debug``.
You can change multiple components in a single call just by adding them to the ``**kwargs`` dict.

Alternatively, you can use the `Developer Tools <https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/tools/dev-tools/>`__
to call the ``logger.set_level`` service with the logging path and desired level as parameters.

Tasks
^^^^^

A task is a lightweight execution context that runs a function inside an event loop, effectively
providing asynchronous (actually, collaborative serial) execution. They are part of Python's
``asyncio`` package and are central to how HASS and pyscript handle multiple activities. Tasks can
run any Python code, provided it does not block (e.g., for I/O) or run without giving up control for
too long (which will prevent other tasks from running).

Task Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These functions allow new tasks to be created and managed. Normally you won't need to create your own
tasks, since trigger functions automatically create a new task to run the function every time the trigger
occurs.

``task.create(func, *args, **kwargs)``
  Creates a new task and calls the given function ``func`` with the positional and keyword arguments.
  Returns the task id of the newly created task.  The task id is an asyncio task object, which
  supports `several methods <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#task-object>`__.
  The function ``func`` runs asynchronously until it returns or the task is cancelled.

``task.cancel(task_id=None)``
  Cancels (kills) the task specified by the ``task_id`` returned by ``task.create``. This is a
  simpler alternative to the ``task_id.cancel()`` method, which also requires waiting for the
  task to cancel. With no argument, ``task.cancel`` cancels the current task, which you might prefer
  to use in a trigger function on error, instead of a `return` or raising an exception.

``task.current_task()``
  Returns the task id of the current task.

``task.name2id(name=None)``
  Returns the task id given a name that task previously passed to ``task.unique``. A ``NameError`` exception
  is raised if the task name is unknown. With no arguments it returns a dict mapping all names to task ids.
  The names are specific to the current global context.

``task.wait(task_set)``
  Waits until the given set of tasks complete. This function calls ``asyncio.wait``, so it takes the same arguments.
  ``task_set`` is a set or list of task ids, and it returns two sets of done and pending task ids.  An example:

  .. code:: python

    done, pending = task.wait({task_id1, task_id2})

  This waits until both tasks complete, and sets ``done`` to ``{task_id1, task_id2}`` and ``pending`` to an
  empty set (``pending`` might be non-empty if you specify a timeout or ``return_when``).

  You can check if a task is done with ``task_id.done()``.  After a task has finished, the function's return
  value is available as ``task_id.result()``, which raises an exception if the task is not finished or was cancelled.

``task.add_done_callback(task_id, func, *args, **kwargs)``
  This is a more convenient alternative to the ``task_id.add_done_callback`` method that supports both pyscript
  function (coroutine) and regular function callbacks. The function ``func`` with the specified arguments
  is called when the task completes.  Multiple callbacks (with different functions) can be added to one task.
  If you use the same ``func`` argument it replaces the prior callback for that function (i.e., only one done
  callback per function is supported).

``task.remove_done_callback(task_id, func)``
  This is a more convenient alternative to the ``task_id.remove_done_callback`` method that supports
  both pyscript function (coroutine) and regular function callbacks. This removes a previously added
  done callback, and the callback to that function will no longer occur when the task completes.

Task executor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you call any Python functions that do I/O or otherwise block, they need to be run outside the
main event loop using ``task.executor``:

``task.executor(func, *args, **kwargs)``
  Run the given function in a separate thread. The first argument is the function to be called,
  followed by each of the positional or keyword arguments that function expects. The ``func``
  argument can only be a regular Python function (e.g., defined in an imported module), not a
  function defined in pyscript. ``task.executor`` waits for the function to complete in the
  other thread, and it returns the return value from the function ``func``.

See `this section <#avoiding-event-loop-i-o>`__ for more information.

Task sleep
~~~~~~~~~~

``task.sleep(seconds)``
  sleeps for the indicated number of seconds, which can be floating point. Do not import ``time``
  and use ``time.sleep()`` - that will block lots of other activity.

.. _Task unique function:

Task unique
~~~~~~~~~~~

``task.unique(task_name, kill_me=False)``
  kills any currently running task that previously called ``task.unique`` with the same
  ``task_name``. The name can be any string. If ``kill_me=True`` then the current task is
  killed if another task that is running previously called ``task.unique`` with the same
  ``task_name``.

Note that ``task.unique`` is specific to the current global context, so names used in one
global context will not affect another.

Once a task calls ``task.unique`` with a name, that name can be used to look up the task
id by name using ``task.name2id``. So even if ``task.unique`` is not used to kill a prior
task, it can be used to associate that task with a name which might be helpful if you need
to manage specific tasks (e.g., cancel them, wait for them to complete, or get their return
value when they finish).

A task can call ``task.unique`` multiple times with different names, which will kill
any tasks that previously called ``task.unique`` with each of those names. The task
continues to "own" all of those names, so any one of them could subsequently be used
by a different task to kill the original task. Any of those names can be used to find
the task id by name using ``task.name2id``.

``task.unique`` can also be called outside a function, for example in the preamble of a script file
or interactively using Jupyter. That causes any currently running functions (i.e., functions that have
already been triggered and are running Python code) that previously called ``task.unique`` with the
same name to be terminated. Since any currently running functions are not terminated on reload, this
is the mechanism you can use should you wish to terminate specific functions on reload. If used
outside a function or interactively with Jupyter, calling ``task.unique`` with ``kill_me=True``
causes ``task.unique`` to do nothing.

The ``task.unique`` functionality is also provided via a decorator ``@task_unique``. If your
function immediately and always calls ``task.unique``, you could choose instead to use the
equivalent function decorator form.

Task waiting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``task.wait_until(**kwargs)``
  allows functions to wait for events, using identical syntax to the decorators. This can be
  helpful if at some point during execution of some logic you want to wait for some additional
  triggers.

It takes the following keyword arguments (all are optional):

- ``state_trigger=None`` can be set to a string just like ``@state_trigger``, or it can be
  a list of strings that are logically "or"ed together.
- ``time_trigger=None`` can be set to a string or list of strings with
  datetime specifications, just like ``@time_trigger``.
- ``event_trigger=None`` can be set to a string or list of two strings, just like
  ``@event_trigger``. The first string is the name of the event, and the second string
  (when the setting is a two-element list) is an expression based on the event parameters.
- ``mqtt_trigger=None`` can be set to a string or list of two strings, just like
  ``@mqtt_trigger``. The first string is the MQTT topic, and the second string
  (when the setting is a two-element list) is an expression based on the message variables.
- ``webhook_trigger=None`` can be set to a string or list of two strings, just like ``@webhook_trigger``. The first string is the webhook id, and the second string (when the setting is a two-element list) is an expression based on the message variables.
- ``webhook_local_only=True`` is used with ``webhook_trigger`` to specify whether to only allow
  local webhooks.
- ``webhook_methods={"POST", "PUT"}`` is used with ``webhook_trigger`` to specify allowed webhook
  request methods.
- ``timeout=None`` an overall timeout in seconds, which can be floating point.
- ``state_check_now=True`` if set, ``task.wait_until()`` checks any ``state_trigger``
  immediately to see if it is already ``True``, and will return immediately if so. If
  ``state_check_now=False``, ``task.wait_until()`` waits until a state variable change occurs,
  before checking the expression. Using ``True`` is safer to help avoid race conditions, although
  ``False`` makes ``task.wait_until()`` behave like ``@state_trigger``, which by default doesn't check
  at startup. However, if you use the default of ``True``, and your function will call
  ``task.wait_until()`` again, it's recommended you set that state variable to some other value
  immediately after ``task.wait_until()`` returns. Otherwise the next call will also return
  immediately. Note that entries in ``state_trigger`` that are plain state variable names
  (which mean trigger on any change) are ignored during this initial check; only expressions
  are evaluated.
- ``state_hold=None`` is an optional numeric duration is seconds. If specified, any ``state_trigger``
  delays returning for this amount of time. If the state trigger expression changes to ``False``
  during that time, the trigger is canceled and a wait for a new trigger begins. If the state
  trigger expression changes, but is still ``True`` then the ``state_hold`` time is not
  restarted - ``task.wait_until()`` will return that number of seconds after the first state
  trigger (unless a different trigger type or a ``timeout`` occurs first). This setting also
  applies to the initial check when ``state_check_now=True``.
- ``state_hold_false=None`` requires the expression evaluate to ``False`` for this duration in seconds
  before a subsequent state trigger occurs. The default value of ``None`` means that the trigger can
  occur without the trigger expression having to be ``False``. A value of ``0`` requires the
  expression become ``False`` before the trigger, but with no minimum time in that state.
  When ``state_hold_false`` is set, the state trigger expression is evaluated immediately. If ``False``
  the ``state_hold_false`` period begins. If ``True``, a wait for the next ``False`` value begins.
  If ``state_check_now`` is also set, ``task.wait_until()`` will still return immediately if the
  expression is initially ``True``.

When a trigger occurs, the return value is a ``dict`` containing the same keyword values that are
passed into the function when the corresponding decorator trigger occurs. There will always be a key
``trigger_type`` that will be set to:

- ``"state"``, ``"time"`` or ``"event"`` when each of those triggers occur.
- ``"timeout"`` if there is a timeout after ``timeout`` seconds (the ``dict`` has no other values)
- ``"none"`` if you specify only ``time_trigger`` and no ``timeout``, and there is no future next
  time that satisfies the trigger condition (e.g., a ``range`` or ``once`` is now in the past).
  Otherwise, ``task.wait_until()`` would never return.

In the special case that ``state_check_now=True`` and ``task.wait_until()`` returns immediately, the
other return variables that capture the variable name and value that just caused the trigger are not
included in the ``dict`` - it will just contain ``trigger_type="state"``.

Here's an example. Whenever a door is opened, we want to do something if the door closes within 30
seconds. If a timeout of more than 30 seconds elapses (i.e., the door is still open), we want to do
some other action. We use a decorator trigger when the door is opened, and we use
``task.wait_until`` to wait for either the door to close, or a timeout of 30 seconds to elapse. The
return value tells which of the two events happened:

.. code:: python

   @state_trigger("security.rear_door == 'open'")
   def rear_door_open_too_long():
       """send alert if door is open for more than 30 seconds"""
       trig_info = task.wait_until(
                       state_trigger="security.rear_door == 'closed'",
                       timeout=30
                   )
       if trig_info["trigger_type"] == "timeout":
           # 30 seconds elapsed without the door closing; do some actions
           pass
       else:
           # the door closed within 30 seconds; do some other actions
           pass

``task.wait_until()`` is logically equivalent to using the corresponding decorators, with some
important differences. Consider these two alternatives, which each run some code whenever there is
an event ``test_event3`` with parameters ``args == 20`` and ``arg2 == 30``:

.. code:: python

   @event_trigger("test_event3", "arg1 == 20 and arg2 == 30")
   def process_test_event3(**trig_info):
       # do some things, including waiting a while
       task.sleep(5)
       # do some more things

versus:

.. code:: python

   @time_trigger    # empty @time_trigger means run the function on startup
   def wait_for_then_process_test_event3():
       while 1:
           trig_info = task.wait_until(
                           event_trigger=["test_event3", "arg1 == 20 and arg2 == 30"]
                       )
           # do some things, including waiting a while
           task.sleep(5)
           # do some more things

Logically they are the similar, but the important differences are:

- ``task.wait_until()`` only looks for the trigger conditions when it is called, and it stops
  monitoring them as soon as it returns. That means the trigger (especially an event trigger) could
  occur before or after ``task.wait_until()`` is called, and you will miss the event. In contrast,
  the decorator triggers monitor the trigger conditions continuously, so they will not miss state
  changes or events once they are initialized. The reason for the ``state_check_now`` argument, and
  its default value of ``True`` is to help avoid this race condition for state triggers. Time
  triggers should generally be safe.

- The decorators run each trigger function as a new independent task, and don't wait for it to
  finish. So a function will be run for every matching event. In contrast, if your code runs for a
  while before calling ``task.wait_until()`` again (e.g., ``task.sleep()`` or any code), or even if
  there is no other code in the ``while`` loop, some events or state changes of interest will be
  potentially missed.

Summary: use trigger decorators whenever you can. Be especially cautious using ``task.wait_until()``
to wait for events; you must make sure your logic is robust to missing events that happen before or
after ``task.wait_until()`` runs.

Global Context
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each pyscript file that is loaded, and each Jupyter session, runs inside its own global context,
which means its global variables and functions are isolated from each other (unless they are a
module or package that is explicitly imported). In normal use you don't need to worry about global
contexts. But for interactive debugging and development, you might want your Jupyter session to
access variables and functions defined in a script file.

Here is the naming convention for each file's global context (upper case means any value;
lower case means actual fixed names):

  ======================================= ===========================
  pyscript file path                      global context name
  ======================================= ===========================
  ``pyscript/FILE.py``                    ``file.FILE``
  ``pyscript/modules/MODULE.py``          ``modules.MODULE``
  ``pyscript/modules/MODULE/__init__.py`` ``modules.MODULE``
  ``pyscript/modules/MODULE/FILE.py``     ``modules.MODULE.FILE``
  ``pyscript/apps/APP.py``                ``apps.APP``
  ``pyscript/apps/APP/__init__.py``       ``apps.APP``
  ``pyscript/apps/APP/FILE.py``           ``apps.APP.FILE``
  ``pyscript/scripts/FILE.py``            ``scripts.FILE``
  ``pyscript/scripts/DIR1/FILE.py``       ``scripts.DIR1.FILE``
  ``pyscript/scripts/DIR1/DIR2/FILE.py``  ``scripts.DIR1.DIR2.FILE``
  ======================================= ===========================

Note that if the package form of an app or module (``pyscript/apps/APP/__init__.py`` or
``pyscript/modules/MODULE/__init__.py``) exists, the module form (``pyscript/apps/APP.py``
or ``pyscript/modules/MODULE.py``) is ignored.

The logging path uses the global context name, so you can customize logging verbosity for each
global context, to the granularity of specific functions e.g.,

.. code:: yaml

   logger:
     default: info
     logs:
       custom_components.pyscript.file: info
       custom_components.pyscript.file.my_script.my_function: debug
       custom_components.pyscript.apps.my_app: debug
       custom_components.pyscript.apps.my_app.my_function: debug

Each Jupyter global context name is ``jupyter_NNN`` where ``NNN`` is a unique integer starting at 0.

You can set the log level for one or more logging paths by calling the ``logger.set_level`` service
from Jupyter, VSC, or in a ``pyscript`` script; for example:

  .. code:: python

    logger.set_level(**{"custom_components.pyscript.file.my_script": "debug"})

will change the log level for the ``my_script.py`` script to ``debug``.

When a script file has changed (or an app's configuration has changed, provided the ``yaml`` file is
below the ``pyscript`` directory), a reload is triggered, and the corresponding global context whose
names start with ``file.``, ``modules.``, ``apps.`` or ``scripts.`` is removed. As each file is
reloaded, the corresponding global context is created.

Three functions are provided for getting, setting and listing the global contexts. That allows
you to interactively change the global context during a Jupyter session. You could also use these
functions in your script files, but that is strongly discouraged because it violates the name
space isolation among the script files. Here are the functions:

``pyscript.get_global_ctx()``
  returns the current global context name.
``pyscript.list_global_ctx()``
  lists all the global contexts, with the current global context listed first.
``pyscript.set_global_ctx(new_ctx_name)``
  sets the current global context to the given name.

When you exit a Jupyter session, its global context is deleted, which means any triggers, functions,
services, and variables you created are deleted (HASS state variables survive). If you switch to a
script file's context, then any triggers, functions, services or variables you interactively create
there will persist after you exit the Jupyter session. However, if you don't update the
corresponding script file, whenever the script is modified and automatically reloaded,
or upon HASS restart, those interactive changes will be lost, since reloading a script
file recreates a new global context.

Advanced Topics
---------------

Workflow
^^^^^^^^

Without Jupyter, the pyscript workflow involves editing scripts in the ``<config>/pyscript`` folder.
Each time a file is changed, it is automatically reloaded. You will need to look at the log file
for error messages (e.g., syntax errors), or log output from your code.

If a module or app file (or any ``yaml`` files in the ``pyscript`` directory) has changed, all files
in that module or app get reloaded too, and also any other files that import that module. If you
want to reload all the files, call the ``pyscript.reload`` service with the optional parameter
``global_ctx`` set to ``*``.

An excellent alternative to repeatedly modifying a script file is to use Jupyter notebook to
interactively develop and test functions, triggers, and services.

Jupyter auto-completion (with ``<TAB>``) is supported in Jupyter notebook, console and lab. It should
work after you have typed at least the first character. After you hit ``<TAB>`` you should see a list
of potential completions from which you can select. It's a great way to easily see available state
variables, functions or services.

In a Jupyter session, one or more functions can be defined in each code cell. Every time that cell
is executed (e.g., ``<Shift>Return``), those functions are redefined, and any existing trigger
decorators with the same function name are canceled and replaced by the new definition. You might
have other function and trigger definitions in another cell - they won't be affected (assuming those
function names are different), and they will only be replaced when you re-execute that other cell.

When the Jupyter session is terminated, its global context is deleted, which means any trigger
rules, functions, services, and variables you created are deleted. The pyscript Jupyter kernel is
intended as an interactive sandbox. As you finalize specific functions, triggers and automation
logic, you should copy them to a pyscript script file, which will automatically reloaded once
that file is written. That ensures they will be loaded and run each time you re-start HASS.

If a function you define has been triggered and is currently executing Python code, then re-running
the cell in which the function is defined, or exiting the Jupyter session, will not stop or cancel
the already running function. This is the same behavior as reload. In pyscript, each triggered
function (i.e., a trigger has occurred, the trigger conditions are met, and the function is actually
executing Python code) runs as an independent task until it finishes. So if you are testing triggers
of a long-running function (e.g., one that uses ``task.sleep()`` or ``task.wait_until()``) you could end
up with many running instances. It's strongly recommended that you use ``task.unique()`` to make sure
old running function tasks are terminated when a new one is triggered. Then you can manually call
``task.unique()`` to terminate that last running function before exiting the Jupyter session.

If you switch global contexts to a script file's context, and create some new variables, triggers,
functions or services there, then those objects will survive the termination of your Jupyter
session. However, if you reload that script, those newly-created objects will no longer exist.
To make any additions or changes permanent (meaning they will be re-created on each reload or each
time your restart HASS) then you should copy the changes or additions to one of your pyscript script
files.

Importing
^^^^^^^^^

Pyscript supports importing two types of packages or modules:

- Pyscript code can be put into modules or packages and stored in the ``<config>/pyscript/modules`` folder.
  Any pyscript code can import and use these modules or packages. These modules are not autoloaded
  on startup; they are only loaded when another script imports them. Any changes to a module's files
  will cause all of the module files to be unloaded, and any scripts or apps that import that module
  will be reloaded. Imports of pyscript modules and packages are not affected by the ``allow_all_imports``
  setting - if a file is in the ``<config>/pyscript/modules`` folder then it can be imported.

  Package-style layout is also supported where a PACKAGE is defined in
  ``<config>/pyscript/modules/PACKAGE/__init__.py``, and that file can, in turn,
  do relative imports of other files in that same directory. This form is most convenient for
  sharing useful pyscript libraries, since all the files for one package are stored in its own
  directory.

- Installed Python packages can be imported. By default, pyscript only allows a short list of Python
  packages to be imported, for both security reasons and to reduce the risk that package functions
  that block doing I/O are called.

The rest of this section discusses the second style - importing installed Python modules and packages.

If you set the ``allow_all_imports`` configuration parameter, any available Python package can be
imported. You should be cautious about setting this if you are going to install community pyscript
code without inspecting it, since it could, for example, ``import os`` and call ``os.remove()``.
However, if you are developing your own code then there is no issue with enabling all imports.

Pyscript code is run using an asynchronous interpreter, which allows it to run in the HASS main
event loop. That allows many of the "magic" features to be implemented without the user having to
worry about the details. However, the performance will be much slower that regular Python code,
which is typically compiled. Any Python packages you import will run at native, compiled speed.

So if you plan to run large chunks of code in pyscript without needing any of the pyscript-specific
features, or you want access to native Python features that aren't supported in pyscript (like
``yield``, ``open``, ``read``, or ``write``), you might consider putting them in a package and
importing it instead. That way it will run at native compiled speed and have full access to
the native Python language.

One way to do that is in one of your pyscript script files, add this code:

.. code:: python

    import sys

    if "/config/pyscript_modules" not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append("/config/pyscript_modules")

This adds the directory ``/config/pyscript_modules`` to Python's module search path (you should use
the correct full path specific to your installation). You will need to set the ``allow_all_imports``
configuration parameter to ``true``  to allow importing of ``sys``. You can then add modules (files
ending in ``.py``) to that folder, which will contain native Python that is compiled when imported
(note that none of the pyscript-specific features are available in those modules).

Pyscript can install required Python packages if they are missing. Depending on how you run HASS
(e.g., using a minimal Docker container) it might not be convenient to manually install Python packages
using ``pip``. If your pyscript code requires particular Python packages that are not already installed
by HASS, add a ``requirements.txt`` file the ``<config>/pyscript`` directory. This file lists each
required package one per line, with an optional version if you require a specific version or minimum
version of that package, e.g.,

.. code::

   # this is a comment
   aiohttp
   amazing_stuff==3.1
   another_package==5.1.2

When a specific version of a package is required, the ``==`` specifier must be used. Unpinned packages
(no version specified) are also accepted, but the highest pinned version will always take precedence
when a package has been specified as a requirement multiple times.

Each app or module's directory (assuming they use the directory-form of a package) can also
contain an optional ``requirements.txt`` file:

- ``<config>/pyscript/modules/my-package-name/requirements.txt``
- ``<config>/pyscript/apps/APP_NAME/requirements.txt``

That allows you to specify the specific requirements for each pyscript module or app. If you release
or share your module or app, all its code and requirements are self-contained, and any user can
simply install the files in that directory and the requirements will be checked on the next
start of HASS or reload.

If a required package version differs from the installed one, no change is made since it's likely
HASS has a requirement that pyscript should not change. In that case a warning message will be
logged and the requirement will be skipped.

Trigger Closures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pyscript supports trigger functions that are defined as closures (i.e., functions defined inside
another function). This allows you to easily create many similar trigger functions that might
differ only in a couple of parameters (e.g., a common function in different rooms or for each
media setup). The trigger will be stopped when the function is no longer referenced in
any scope. Typically the closure function is returned, and the return value is assigned
to a variable. If that variable is re-assigned or deleted, the trigger function will be
destroyed.

Here's an example:

.. code:: python

        def state_trigger_factory(sensor_name, trig_value):

            @state_trigger(f"input_boolean.{sensor_name} == '{trig_value}'")
            def func_trig(value=None):
                log.info(f"func_trig: {sensor_name} is {value}")

            return func_trig

        f1 = state_trigger_factory("test1", "on")
        f2 = state_trigger_factory("test2", "on")
        f3 = state_trigger_factory("test3", "on")

This creates three trigger functions that fire when the given sensor ``input_boolean.testN`` is
``on``. If you re-assign or delete ``f1`` then that trigger will be destroyed, and the other two
will not be affected. If you repeatedly re-run this block of code in Jupyter the right thing will
happen - each time it runs the old triggers are destroyed when the variables are re-assigned.

Any data type could be used to maintain a reference to the trigger function. For example
a list could be manually built:

.. code:: python

    input_boolean_test_triggers = [
        state_trigger_factory("test1", "on"),
        state_trigger_factory("test2", "on"),
        state_trigger_factory("test3", "on")
    ]

or dynamically in a loop:

.. code:: python

    input_boolean_test_triggers = []
    for i in range(1, 4):
        input_boolean_test_triggers.append(state_trigger_factory(f"test{i}", "on"))

If you are writing a factory function and you prefer the caller not to bother with
maintaining variables with the closure functions, you could move the appending into
the function and use a global variable (a class could also be used):

.. code:: python

        input_boolean_test_triggers = []

        def state_trigger_factory(sensor_name, trig_value):

            @state_trigger(f"input_boolean.{sensor_name} == '{trig_value}'")
            def func_trig(value=None):
                log.info(f"func_trig: {sensor_name} is {value}")

            input_boolean_test_triggers.append(func_trig)

        state_trigger_factory("test1", "on")
        state_trigger_factory("test2", "on")
        state_trigger_factory("test3", "on")

Notice there is no return value from the factory function.

A ``dict`` could be used instead of a list, with a key that combines the unique parameters
of the trigger. That way a new trigger with the same parameters will replace an old one
when the ``dict`` entry is set, if that's the behavior you want.

Accessing YAML Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pyscript binds all of its ``yaml`` configuration to the variable ``pyscript.config``. That allows
you to add configuration settings that can be processed by your pyscript code. Additionally, an
application's configuration (e.g., for an application ``app_name``, all the settings in ``app_name``
below ``apps``) are available in the variable ``pyscript.app_config`` in the global scope of the
application's main file (e.g., ``apps/app_name.py`` or ``apps/app_name/__init__.py``).  Note that
``pyscript.app_config`` is not defined in regular scripts - only in each application's main file.

One motivation is to allow pyscript apps to be developed and shared that can instantiate triggers
and logic based on ``yaml`` configuration. That allows other users to use and configure your
pyscript code without needing to edit or even understand it - they just need to add the
corresponding ``yaml`` configuration.

The configuration for an application should be placed below that application's name under the
``apps`` configuration key.  For example, the settings for a pyscript application called
``auto_lights`` below an entry ``apps``. That entry could contain a list of settings (e.g., for
handling multiple rooms or locations).

Here's an example ``yaml`` configuration with settings for two applications, ``auto_lights``
and ``motion_light``:

.. code:: yaml

   pyscript:
     allow_all_imports: true
     apps:
       auto_lights:
         - room: living
           level: 60
           some_list:
            - 1
            - 20
         - room: dining
           level: 80
           some_list:
            - 1
            - 20
       motion_light:
         - sensor: rear_left
           light: rear_flood
         - sensor: side_yard
           light: side_flood
         - sensor: front_patio
           light: front_porch
     global:
       setting1: 10
       setting2: true

For the ``auto_lights`` application, those settings are available to that application's main
source file (e.g., ``apps/auto_lights.py`` or ``apps/auto_lights/__init__.py``) in the global
variable ``pyscript.app_config``, which will be set to:

.. code:: python

   [
       {"room": "living", "level": 60, "some_list": [1, 20]},
       {"room": "dining", "level": 80, "some_list": [1, 20]},
   ],

The corresponding global ``pyscript.config`` variable value will be:

.. code:: python

   {
       "allow_all_imports": True,
       "apps": {
           "auto_lights": [
               {"room": "living", "level": 60, "some_list": [1, 20]},
               {"room": "dining", "level": 80, "some_list": [1, 20]},
           ],
           "motion_light": [
               {"sensor": "rear_left", "light": "rear_flood"},
               {"sensor": "side_yard", "light": "side_flood"},
               {"sensor": "front_patio", "light": "front_porch"},
           ],
       },
       "global": {
           "setting1": 10,
           "setting2": True,
       },
   }

Note that accessing ``pyscript.config["apps"]`` is deprecated.  The ``apps`` entry will be removed
in a future release so that apps do not have access to another app's configuration
(which might include token, passwords or keys).

Your application code for ``auto_lights`` would be in either

- ``<config>/pyscript/apps/auto_lights.py``
- ``<config>/pyscript/apps/auto_lights/__init__.py``

It can simply iterate over ``pyscript.app_config`` settings up the necessary
triggers and application logic, e.g.,

.. code:: python

   def setup_triggers(room=None, level=None, some_list=None):
       #
       # define some trigger functions etc
       #
       pass

   for inst in pyscript.app_config:
       setup_triggers(**inst)

Validating the configuration can be done either manually or with the ``voluptuous`` package.

Secrets can also be bound to variables by substituting the value with ``!secret my_secret``. This is useful for API keys or passwords.

Here is an example config for ``service_checker`` which needs a name (not a secret) and a URL and an API key (which are secret):

.. code:: yaml

   pyscript:
     allow_all_imports: true
     apps:
       service_checker:
         - service_name: my_service
           url: !secret my_secret_url
           api_key: !secret my_secret_api_key

Access to Hass
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the ``hass_is_global`` configuration setting is set (default is off), then the variable ``hass``
is available as a global variable in all pyscript contexts. That provides significant flexibility
in accessing HASS internals for cases where pyscript doesn't provide some binding or access.

Ideally you should only use ``hass`` for read-only access. However, you do need a good understanding
of ``hass`` internals and objects if you try to call functions or update anything. With great power
comes great responsibility!

For example, you can access configuration settings like ``hass.config.latitude`` or ``hass.config.time_zone``.

You can use ``hass`` to compute sunrise and sunset times using the same method HASS does, e.g.,

.. code:: python

   import homeassistant.helpers.sun as sun
   import datetime

   location = sun.get_astral_location(hass)
   sunrise = location[0].sunrise(datetime.datetime.today()).replace(tzinfo=None)
   sunset = location[0].sunset(datetime.datetime.today()).replace(tzinfo=None)
   print(f"today sunrise = {sunrise}, sunset = {sunset}")

(Note that the ``sun.sun`` attributes already provide times for the next sunrise and sunset, so
this example is a bit contrived.  Also note this only applies to HA 2021.5 and later; prior
to that, ``sun.get_astral_location()`` doesn't return the elevation, so replace ``location[0]``
with ``location`` in the two expressions if you have an older version of HA.)

Here's another method that uses the installed version of ``astral`` directly, rather than the HASS
helper function. HA 2021.5 upgraded to ``astral 2.2``, and here's one way of getting sunrise
using this version (prior to this HA used a very old version of ``astral``).

.. code:: python

   import astral
   import astral.location
   import datetime

   here = astral.location.Location(astral.LocationInfo("City", "Country", str(hass.config.time_zone),
                                                       hass.config.latitude, hass.config.longitude))
   sunrise = here.sunrise(datetime.datetime.today()).replace(tzinfo=None)
   sunset = here.sunset(datetime.datetime.today()).replace(tzinfo=None)
   print(f"today sunrise = {sunrise}, sunset = {sunset}")

If there are particular HASS internals that you think many pyscript users would find useful,
consider making a feature request or PR so it becomes a built-in feature in pyscript, rather
than requiring users to always have to delve into ``hass``.

Avoiding Event Loop I/O
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All pyscript code runs in the HASS main event loop. That means if you execute code that blocks, for
example doing I/O like reading or writing files or fetching a URL, then the main loop in HASS will
be blocked, which will delay all other tasks.

All the built-in functionality in pyscript is written using asynchronous code, which runs seamlessly
together with all the other tasks in the main event loop. However, if you import Python packages and
call functions that block (any type of file, network I/O, http etc), you will block the main loop and
that will make HASS less responsive.  HASS might report an error like this:

::

    WARNING (MainThread) [homeassistant.util.loop] Detected blocking call to ... inside the event loop by custom
    integration 'pyscript' at custom_components/pyscript/eval.py, line 1982: return func(*args, **kwargs)
    (offender: ...), please create a bug report at https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript/issues

    For developers, please see https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/asyncio_blocking_operations/#open

This warning is a reminder that you should not block the main loop. Do not file a bug report - the
issue is almost certainly in your code, not pyscript.  You should review
the `developer link <https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/asyncio_blocking_operations/#open>`__ for
a good summary of the numerous ways you can inadvently write pyscript code that blocks the main event loop.

Currently built-in functions that do I/O, such as ``open``, ``read`` and ``write`` are not supported
in pyscript to avoid I/O in the main event loop, and also to avoid security issues if people share pyscripts.
Also, the ``print`` function only logs a message, rather than implements the real ``print`` features, such
as specifying an output file handle.

The ``task.executor`` function is a way to run a blocking function in a separate thread, so it doesn't
stall the main event loop. It's a good way to run blocking code, but it's not as efficient as using
async I/O directly:

``task.executor(func, *args, **kwargs)``
  Run the given function in a separate thread. The first argument is the function to be called,
  followed by each of the positional or keyword arguments that function expects. The ``func``
  argument can only be a regular Python function, not a function defined in pyscript.

If you want to do file or network I/O from pyscript, or make any system calls that might block,
three are three main choices:

- Use async versions of the I/O functions you need (eg, ``ascyncio``, ``aiohttp`` etc).  This is the
  recommended approach.
- put the code in a separate native Python module, so that functions like ``open``, ``read`` and ``write``
  are available, and call the function in that module from pyscript using ``task.executor``. See
  `Importing <#importing>`__ for how to set Python's ``sys.path`` to import a local Python module.
- if you really need to do file I/O directly, you could use the ``os`` package (which can be imported by
  setting ``allow_all_imports``) and calling the low-level functions like ``os.open`` and ``os.read`` using
  ``task.executor`` to wrap every function that calls those blocking functions.

An additional trap is using modules that do lazy loading (e.g., `pytz`), which load certain data only when
needed (e.g., specific time zone data in the case of `pytz`).  That delays the blocking file I/O until
run-time (when it's running in the main event loop), which is bad, rather than at load time when pyscript
loads it in a separate thread.  So you will need to avoid lazy loading modules, or be sure to call them
at load time (i.e., outside a function in one of your scripts) in a manner that causes them to load all
the data they need. For `pytz` , you should use `zoneinfo` instead, which is in the standard library and
doesn't appear to do lazy loading.

Here's an example fetching a URL. Inside pyscript, this is the wrong way since it does I/O without
using a separate thread:

.. code:: python

    import requests

    # Do not fetch URLs this way!
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/custom-components/pyscript/master/README.md"
    resp = requests.get(url)

The correct way is:

.. code:: python

    import requests

    # Better - uses task.executor to run the blocking function in a separate thread
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/custom-components/pyscript/master/README.md"
    resp = task.executor(requests.get, url)

An even better solution to fetch a URL is to use a Python package that uses asyncio, in which case
there is no need for ``task.executor``. In this case, ``aiohttp`` can be used (the ``await`` keyword
is optional in pyscript):

.. code:: python

    import aiohttp

    # Best - uses async I/O to avoid blocking the main event loop
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/custom-components/pyscript/master/README.md"
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as resp:
            print(resp.status)
            print(resp.text())

Here's another example that creates a client connection to a TCP server and exchanges messages
in a manner that avoids event loop I/O by using ``asyncio.open_connection``.

.. code:: python

    import asyncio

    Reader, Writer = None, None

    @time_trigger('startup')
    def do_client_connection():
        global Reader, Writer
        Reader, Writer = asyncio.open_connection('127.0.0.1', 8956)

    def client_send(message):
        if not Writer:
           raise("Client is not connected")
        Writer.write(message.encode())
        Writer.drain()
        return Reader.readline().decode()

This connects to the server (in this example at ``127.0.0.1:8956``) at startup, and then you can call
``client_send()`` and it will send the message and return the reply.

This assumes the protocol is line-oriented; you could call ``Reader.read()`` instead if you want to
read bytes instead of expecting a newline with ``Reader.readline()``.

To test the code above, you can create a server by running ``nc -l 8956`` before you run the code.
When you call ``client_send("hello\n")`` you should see the ``hello`` printed by ``nc``.  Then
whatever you type back at ``nc`` will be returned by ``client_send()``.

Persistent State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pyscript has the ability to persist state variables in the ``pyscript.`` domain, meaning their
values and attributes are preserved across HASS restarts. To specify that the value of a particular
entity persists, you need to request persistence explicitly. This must be done in a code location
that will be certain to run at startup.

.. code:: python

   state.persist('pyscript.last_light_on')

   @state_trigger('binary_sensor.motion == "on"')
   def turn_on_lights():
     light.turn_on('light.overhead')
     pyscript.last_light_on = "light.overhead"

With this in place, ``state.persist()`` will be called every time this script is parsed, ensuring the
``pyscript.last_light_on`` state variable state will persist between HASS restarts. If ``state.persist``
is not called on a particular state variable before HASS stops, then that state variable will not be
preserved on the next start.

Language Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pyscript implements a Python interpreter in a fully-async manner, which means it can run safely in the
main HASS event loop.

The language coverage is relatively complete, but there are definitely limitations in pyscript where
it doesn't faithfully mimic Python.  Here are some areas where pyscript differs from real Python:

- The pyscript-specific function names and state names that contain a period are treated as plain
  identifiers that contain a period, rather than an attribute (to the right of the period) of an object
  (to the left of the period). For example, while ``pyscript.reload`` and ``state.get`` are functions, ``pyscript``
  and ``state`` aren't defined. However, if you set ``pyscript`` or ``state`` to some value (i.e., assign them
  as a variable), then ``pyscript.reload`` and ``state.get`` are now treated as accessing those attributes
  in the ``pyscript`` or ``state`` object, rather than calls to the built-in functions, which are no longer
  available. That's similar to regular Python, where if you set ``bytes`` to some value, the ``bytes.fromhex``
  function is no longer available.
- Since pyscript is async, it detects whether functions are real or async, and calls them in the
  correct manner. So it's not necessary to use ``async`` and ``await`` in pyscript code - they are optional.
  However, if you declare a function in pyscript as ``async def``, then it doesn't behave correctly
  like an async function in Python (i.e., calling it actually executes the function, rather than returning
  a co-routine.  If you truly need an async function in your code, use `@pyscript_compile`.
- All pyscript functions are async. So if you call a Python module that takes a pyscript function as
  a callback argument, that argument is an async function, not a normal function. So a Python module
  won't be able to call that pyscript function unless it uses ``await``, which requires that function to
  be declared ``async``. Unless the Python module is designed to support async callbacks, it is not
  currently possible to have Python modules and packages call pyscript functions. The workaround is
  to move your callbacks from pyscript and make them native Python functions; see `Importing <#importing>`__,
  call a function with the ``@pyscript_compile`` decorator, or a lambda (which is also compiled).
- Continuing that point, special methods (e.g., ``__eq__``) in a class created in `pyscript` will not work since
  they are async functions and Python will not be able to call them. The two workarounds are to
  use the ``@pyscript_compile`` decorator so the method is compiled to a native (non-async) Python
  function, or write your class in native Python and import it into ``pyscript``; see `Importing <#importing>`__.
- The ``import`` function in ``pyscript`` fails to import certain complex packages. This is an open bug and
  it would be great if someone with some Python expertise could help fix it. In the meantime, the workaround
  is to import the module in a native Python file, and then import that shim module into pyscript.
  See `Importing <#importing>`__.
- pyscript and the HASS primitives that it uses are not thread safe - the code should only be executed
  in the main event loop. The ``task.executor()`` function is one way that regular Python code
  (not pyscript code) can safely be executed in a separate thread. The ``threading`` package can
  potentially be used (although that is untested), so long as any threads created only run regular
  Python code (and not call any pyscript functions, which are all async). Bad things will happen
  if you call pyscript functions from a thread you create; currently there isn't error checking
  for that case.

A handful of language features are not supported:

- generators and the ``yield`` statement; these are difficult to implement in an interpreter.
- the ``match-case`` statement is not supported.
- built-in functions that do I/O, such as ``open``, ``read``, and ``write`` are not supported to avoid
  I/O in the main event loop, and also to avoid security issues if people share pyscripts. The ``print``
  function only logs a message, rather than implements the real ``print`` features, such as specifying
  an output file handle.
- The built-in function decorators (e.g., ``state_trigger``) aren't functions that can be called and used
  in-line like real Python decorators. However, you can define your own function decorators that
  could include those decorators on the inner functions they define. Currently none of Python's
  built-in decorators are supported.

The typical work-around for places where pyscript falls short is to move that code into a native Python module,
and then import that module into pyscript.  Pyscript can call Python modules and packages, so you could
write your own native Python code (e.g., if you need a generator or other unsupported feature) that can be
called by pyscript (see `Importing <#importing>`__ for how to create and import native Python modules in pyscript).
You can also include native Python functions in your pyscript code by using the ``@pyscript_compile``
decorator.
