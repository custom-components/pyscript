Releases and New Features
=========================

The releases and release notes are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript/releases>`__.
Use HACS to install different versions of pyscript.

You can also install the master (head of tree) version from GitHub, either using HACS or manually.
Because pyscript has quite a few unit tests, generally the master version should work ok. But it's not
guaranteed to work at any random time, and newly-added features might change.

This is 1.6.3, released on March 24, 2025.  Here is the `documentation
<https://hacs-pyscript.readthedocs.io/en/1.6.3>`__ for that release.  Here is the
`stable documentation <https://hacs-pyscript.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`__ for
the latest release.

Over time, the master (head of tree) version in GitHub will include new features and bug fixes.
Here is the `latest documentation <https://hacs-pyscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`__ if you want
to see the development version of the documentation.

If you want to see development progress since 1.6.3, look at the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript>`__.
